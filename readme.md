## Moneythink Scheduler

The Moneythink Scheduler program was developed to assist in the assignment of mentoring sites
to mentors for the Carnegie Mellon University chapter of Moneythink. It accomplishes this
objective by generating the spreadsheets that are used to match mentors with suitable sites based
on inputted iCal files containing the mentors’ schedules.
